Happy to say he was released without harm (though the events leading up to it may have been stressful.) Was found in neighbor's home and one of them had scooped him into a garbage bin. Swore up and down it was a copperhead but thankfully the would-be executioner shared my hesitation to kill it without a positive ID. 

Neighbor also insisted on poking it despite a few of us warning that it can still bite defensively even though we were 99% sure it was non-venomous. Thankfully he had calmed down a bit and was more interested in fleeing back into the bin when I presented it.
