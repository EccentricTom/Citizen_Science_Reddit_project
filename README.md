## Reddit api scraping

Description: 
This is a concept project that will pull user-uploaded images of fish from the subreddit whatsthisfish, along with the top comment of each thread. A dataframe is then created with these pieces of information after being saved into a CSV format. Finally, the results are presented in a Streamlit window for easy reading and hyperlinking to the original picture.
